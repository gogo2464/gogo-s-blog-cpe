By &#34;texture rotations&#34;, we mean the fact that some blocks (like grass or stone) have their textures randomly rotated or flipped based purely on the coordinate of that block, not on the seed. This means that, even without knowing anything about the world itself, the coordinates can still be found quite easily. In theory, you could make your own random world, and if you arrived at the right coordinates, the texture rotations there would look the same as in the screenshot, despite none of the terrain being the same. In practice however, this would take an unimaginably long time to do manually, so there are tools to help with this process.

__How to find coordinates using texture rotations:__
1) To start off with, you have 2 options. Either you can mark and write down the rotations you see in the screenshot manually (relative position of each block + a number assigned to each distinct rotation), or make a recreation of the screenshot in a random world, align yourself with it (type `!!perspective` to see the tools you can use for this), and then use a special resourcepack that can help you identify the rotations in the image (link and tutorial below).
2) When you have the rotations identified, plug the data into the tool linked below to get the coordinates!
The tool + tutorial: &lt;https://github.com/19MisterX98/TextureRotations&gt;

Note: The texture rotation algorithm has changed a few times during the game&#39;s development. There were no texture rotations up until beta 1.8, which introduced lilypads with rotations. Other blocks like grass or stone didn&#39;t have any rotations until release 1.8.
Also note that while bedrock edition also uses texture rotations, they are different from Java, and aren&#39;t supported by the tool above.
