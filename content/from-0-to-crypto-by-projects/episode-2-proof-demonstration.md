## III - Reversing checksum, Method by mathematical proof: disproof

According to the documentation and as it is mentionned that type 7 is an hashing algorithm.

A secure hash algorithm is an hash algorithm so that there does not exist a function `f(enc)` so that `f(enc) = original_plaintext`. 

## 1 - Analysis under mathematical thinking


The reverse engineering of the hash of vigenere cisco has permitted to deduct the method taken by this algorithm.

We could then guess that the researchers thanks then that:

We now have the mathematical proof (demonstration) that the algorithm is vulnerable.
