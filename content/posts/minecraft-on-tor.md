# Philosophy

This is a project about to put a minecraft private server on TOR. 

The Minecraft target has the advantages to:
 - Provide a private server that does not require to maintain code to work: Private servers only work once you have the private server code ready.
 - Allow juridically to deploy a private server: Minecraft provide server binaries. It is then absolutely legal to publish such server.
 - Still proprietary target to force the user to dissect the minecraft source code for future purpose: In the future we could write a private server based on p2p instead of TOR.

# I / Deploy

We are going to run a Minecraft server.
